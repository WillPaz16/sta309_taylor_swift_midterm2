# Sentiment Analysis of Taylor Swift's Albums: Speak Now and Red

The Prompt:

In this problem, you will be performing a sentiment analysis of her music. You will create a dashboard that analyzes her music and how it has changed over time. For your dashboard, do the following:

  * Among the repository is a set of folders containing the lyrics for each of Taylor Swift's albums. Pick two albums. 
  * Include world clouds for the two albums you have chosen. Make sure it is clear which is which, and that you remove stop words!
  * Perform a sentiment analysis comparing these albums. Choose an appropriate visual for this comparison. 
  * The repository also includes a csv file with the Spotify metadata for all of her songs. Create visuals that show the relationship between song sentiment and at least two different musical      attributes of the songs from the Spotify metadata.

The Response:

In response to the prompt, I chose to focus on my two favorite Taylor Swift albums, Speak Now and Red. I displayed the word clouds in the image attatched in the file with the distinct color pallets of Speak Now and Red, being the soft lavender/orchid and vibrant red/tan colors respecively. Then, to dig deeper into the overall proportions of the sentiments included in each album to see if the positive nature of an album is reflected in the sentiment analysis. I'm no die hard Swiftie, but I'm sure one who is one with Taylor's music would either have strong options about said analysis based on their own preconception of the contextuality of each album in regards to the "era" in which Swift was in while writing each album. Lastly, I looked at each song in each ablum to compare them to one another based on the acousticness and valence of the song. Both of these characteristics is what drew me to each of these albums initially, I thought it would be fun to see if songs with proportionally larger sentiments showed any relationship to the acousticness and valence of each song respectively. I hope you enjoy the analysis of the world's biggest artist and icon in music and pop culture.
